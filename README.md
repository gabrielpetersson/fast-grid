# fast-grid - [Try it!](https://fast-grid.vercel.app)

An experiment (and soon NPM package) for how performant a web-table can possibly be

### Capabilites

- Display unlimited rows at O(1), you are only limited by RAM
- Instant results on filtering millions of rows
- 60 fps while cruising the scrollbar

### Technical details

The most performant DOM-based grid.

- Resuses parts of DOM-tree to reduce expensive DOM mutations
- Own event loop to prioritize tasks. Never drops a frame, even when filtering millions of rows
- Non-passive scrolling. Rows will never be seen rows loading into the UI while scrolling
- Custom virtualization and scrolling. Not limited by browsers 15 million pixel div height limit
- Custom built scrolling for phones, and runs at 60fps even on older phones

### One million rows benchmark (Air M2)

| Benchmark                                                 | Score |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Scroll 40 rows every frame                                | 60fps |
| Filtering                                                 | 110ms |
| Time to initialize grid and show rows                     | 1.5ms |
| Scroll 40 rows every frame + filter same time every 300ms | 45fps |

### Need an even more performant table?

This is the most performant _DOM-based_ table. The fastest table ever built (by far), directly using the GPU and streaming rows efficiently from a custom DB, is [dataland.io](https://dataland.io/). It can render billions of rows at ~5x FPS versus a DOM-based table.

### Disclaimers

In the example web-app, sorting is still blocking main thread, meaning it drops frames. Adding to the custom event loop soon.
Also you cannot sort and filter at the same time, a TODO but figuring out how I can do this off-thread and potentially in wasm with a zero copy datatype

### TODO before npm launch

- break out filtering into its own package
- config for sort/filter for all columns
- detach scrollbar from logic, & isolate logic in general
- modify cells
- resize columns
- custom cells
- make sure rows are ordered correctly for text selection
- publish npm package

### TODO features/performance

- expand synthetic event-loop to include scrolling & rendering cell contents
- make scrolling one viewport every frame while filtering a million rows at the same time run 40fps (macbook air)
- support filter + sort at same time
- chunk up sorting so it's not blocking main thread
